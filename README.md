# ModMate
Mod Manager for GTA V installing/uninstalling mods with opening any settings file ( e.g. ini file ) for each mods | easier access and installing/uninstalling


The project uses simple winform application. with JSON.
The application will install mods then auto extract them & place them into your GTAV main directory, the application will record every file has been extracted and it will delete them if you want them to be uninstalled. A lot of features I have added to the project in the last few months

To run a localhost, locate your source files in the CMD then type: py -m http.server 8000 

NOTE: PY OR PYTHON MUST BE INSTALLED IN YOUR SYSTEM IF YOU WANT TO USE THE LOCAL HOST.
It is NOT required for the program to run, it will still reads the JSON settings file even if you turned off your localhost It's just not gonna get updated automatically

For Developers: search in the entire solution "//TODO" for my todo list if you're interested in doing them but you def need to fix the issues 

ModManager -> the Application 

ModMate Manager -> the bot

Dev note: Unfortunately I am unable to continue this project I'm working on a different important project, my final exams are coming up very soon and I do not have time to continue.
